You can run the tests using your preferred method (e.g., through an IDE or command line with Maven). After execution, you'll find an extent.html report file in your project's root directory detailing the results of the tests.

This example demonstrates various HTTP request methods, validation of responses, handling delays, and negative testing scenarios with unauthorized access simulations.
